<h2>Homework, Mulligan and &quot;Sick or Away&quot;<br />
  Frequently Asked Questions
  (IB CS)<br />
</h2>
<p>There are plenty of little details regarding the homework downloads and Mulligans.  Most are straight-forward and logical, but here are some questions you might need clarification with, and their answers, just in case.</p>
<p><strong>General Homework Points</strong></p>
<p><em>Can I copy and paste?</em><br />
  Please only copy and paste when the question sends you to a website to copy and paste some particular information, for example, a definition from webopedia.com.  Otherwise, do you best to put your answers in your own words, the way the answer makes most sense to you.
</p>
<p><em>What do the various marks mean that you add to my documents when you correct them?</em><br />
  Here are the marks I make most often, and what they mean:<br />
  <strong>--&gt; -1</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  you'll only see this if there are 5 or less answers/responses and you get one of them mostly or totally wrong/don't respond.<br />
  <strong>--&gt; -1/2</strong> &nbsp&nbsp the usual deduction for one question mostly or totally wrong, since there are usually around ten questions, and the value of homework assignments is 5.<br />
  <strong>--&gt; Ok</strong> &nbsp&nbsp this means that your answer was not quite right, or your response not quite adequate, but it was close enough to not have any points deducted.<br />
  <strong>--&gt; ...</strong> this means you needed to give more information to properly answer/respond to the question.<br />
And no mark means that your answer/response was good.
<br />

<p><em>-1234?? What's that about?</em><br />
If there's a reason why I need to make a comment, and no grade can be granted, I'll put -1234 as a grade. So -1234 means <em>check</em> your document download link to see a comment explaining why you don't have a grade yet. One reason is often that you submitted a homework assignment without answers. In the case of an assignment, -1234 means there's either a problem, or you missed it, and have to make it up.</p>
<p><em>Do -1234s count in my calculated grade in progress?</em><br />
  Good question. Theey count as 0 for homework assignments, until the problem is resolved. But note that they do not count as 0 for assignments.  Here's the thinking: Chances are actually pretty good that you may not ever get around to correcting the issue of a homework assignment that prompted a -1234, so I'll assume a 0 until it <em>is</em> corrected.  But with the assignments, you <em>have</em> to do them sooner or later; you really don't have an option to take a 0.  So making it temporarily count as 0 would just throw off the predictive nature of the grade in progress. </p>
<p><em>What's the problem if after I upload, I can't see the link back on the upload page?</em><br />
If you go back to the upload page, right after you've uploaded a file, in order to see the link, you'll have to Refresh the upload page.</p>
<p><br />
  <strong>Mulligans</strong></p>
<p><em>Are mulligans for everything that's late...Everything???</em><br />
Mulligans are for absolutely every single situation that result in you not doing your homework by the due date. This could anything from &quot;Had no Internet access&quot;, to &quot;Didn't feel like doing it&quot;. Often enough there will also be family reasons, or extracurricular reasons. But, whatever. The point is that I don't want to have to be the a judge in deciding  what is a valid reason and what is not a valid reason for not doing homework by the due date. Everyone gets four Mulligans, so it's up to you to use them when you need to: no questions asked.</p>
<p>(Though, you really shouldn't use a Mulligan for &quot;Didn't want to do it&quot; kind of reasons; at least that's my humble opinion.)</p>
<p><em>What about Extreme situations</em><br />
Meantime, Mulligans are for everything up to and including tornados that you are not absent for. But if it truly is a serious situation, like having no electricity in your house for several days in a row, then you should only have to use one Mulligan for that situation; talk to me in cases like this..</p>
<p><em>Do I actually have to do the questions?</em><br />
To count as credit, the Mulligans (or SOAs - see below) have to be actually done - they are not a &quot;pass&quot;, they are an excused late submission.</p>
<p><em>Should I save my Mulligans for homework that is worth more than the average points?</em><br />
No, in fact, the amount of a Mulligan that you use each time depends on the value of the homework, compared to the average homework value at that point in the year.  So, for example if the average homework value is 25, and you submit a homework assignment worth 20, you would use up 0.8 (20/25) of a Mulligan.</p>
<p><em>What happens with the remainder portion of my Mulligans?</em><br />
  The idea here is, for example, what if I have 0.5 of a Mulligan left, and I submit a homwork assignment worth approximately the average amount, what happens.  In that case the remaining amount of Mulligan will be gobbled up by the portion of the homework it is equivalent to, and the remaning portion will be graded at 50%.  The exact values used in the calculation will be displayed when you submit.
</p>
<p><em>What happens if I use up all my Mulligans?</em><br />
  It is possible that you will use up all of your Mulligans. What then? Your homework will count at 50% from that point on if it is submitted late.<br />
</p>
<p><strong><br />
  SOAs (&quot;Sick or Aways&quot;)</strong></p>
<p><em>Could you explain again what the &quot;Sick or Away&quot; check boxes are all about.</em><br />
  These are what you'll check if/when you are away or sick the day that a homework assignment is due. Remember that you don't have to do the assignment in these cases, and they won't count, but you're welcome to do them and get the 5/5. Check &quot;Sick or Away (excuse only uploaded)&quot; if you don't want to do it at all; but upload a .doc file with the date and reason you missed. Or check &quot;Sick or Away (excuse &amp; HW uploaded) if you want to get the points; but include an explanation with the date and reason you missed.</p>
<p><em>Do you actually have to be sick or away to use an SOA?</em><br />
  SOAs only will count when you are sick and absent, or absent for some other reason. All other missing homework situation are Mulligan situations. See the Mulligan situation above.</p>
<p><em>What does -999 as a grade indicate?</em><br />
-999 indicates that you were sick or away either the day before the homework was due, or the day the homework was due.</p>
<p><em>If sick or away do I have to make up the assignment?</em><br />
You may make up the missed homework at any time for full credit, or you may choose to not do it at all. I would prefer that you do it at some point, since it is part of the course for a reason; it is for your own learning, not just for a grade. But if you have a lot of work to make up after being away, I understand if you choose not to do it.</p>
<p><em>How long do I have to make up an SOA assignment?</em><br />
You have exactly 10 days from the original due date. The ten days goes from 10:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. After the ten day period you will no longer be able to upload SOAs; in fact the check boxes to do so will no longer appear. </p>
<p><em>Why the 10 day limit?</em><br />
  It's a ten day limit because otherwise either or both you and I will forget whether or not you really were sick or away on any given date.  But ten days should be plenty of time to, at the very least, upload a note saying you  won't be doing the homework for credit.  In any extenuating circumstances - for example, being away for a week or so - just see me in person when you get back.
</p>
<p> <em>What if I see a -999, but I just haven't gotten around to doing it for a grade?</em><br />
If I get to marking the homework before you get a chance to make up a &quot;Sick Or Away&quot; homework, you'll see a -999 for the mark. But that does not mean that it is too late to upload it in its completed form, should you choose to. Just upload it, and when I mark it, a (probably) 5/5 will replace the -999.</p>
<p><em>How come I got my Mulligan or SOA mark, but there's no comment on the actual linked document?</em><br />
The Mulligans and &quot;SOA&quot; files get uploaded directly to my desktop, as well as to the folder that has the rest of your homework. When I mark the Mulligans and the &quot;SOA&quot;s I won't usually have the time navigate to the other specific homework folder as well. Rather, I'll just mark the version on my desktop, and update the mark. This means you won't see a grade and comments on the actual file linked to your homework page; for these you'll only see the number grade on the webpage. (The exception to this is homework that you will need to look at to review for testing - that I will make sure is corrected and commented in the place where you can access it by clicking on the link to your downloaded file.)</p>
<p><em>What if I make a mistake using Mulligans or Sick or Aways?<br />
</em>If it is completely obvious that you've made a mistake with how you used your Mulligans or Sick or Aways, then I'll manually change your number of Mulligans. I'll call this a &quot;Mulligan Mulligan&quot;, and you all get only one.</p>
