<h2>What is computer science, in the first place?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A Definition of Computer Science:</em></p>
<p>Computer science is the Science behind the planning, building, and management of complex systems. Though applicable to any and all complex systems, computer science today is mainly applied to information systems which manage potentially vast sums of data. </p>
<p>Programming is the part of Computer Science which builds the instructional components that control those systems - it is the communication bridge between computer scientists and the hardware that manages  complex systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Some  JSR Points About Computer Science To Ponder<br />
  <br />
</em></p>
<p> - In terms of instructions to computers, i.e. programming, whatever you can dream, you can BUILD.  So computer science provides a tool-kit for Builders and Dreamers.</p>
<p>- As a course of study, &quot;Computer Science is not so much about what's inside a computer as it is about what's inside your head&quot;. Or put another way, inside the Computer Science classroom, you don't learn to use a computer as much as you learn to use your brain.</p>
<p>- Is programming an art as well as a science?<br />
  Well, in terms of art, you could say that what makes art art, is that it's stuff with which you can do whatever the freak you want, in any creative way you can dream of.  So is programming an art?  You could thus argue yes...
:-)</p>
<p>- Science takes complexity (life, physical forces, chemistry, space...) and breaks it down piece by piece, trying to explain it, in more and more precise ways, looking, one could argue, in fact, for Truth.<br />
Comptuer science goes the other way.  It takes simple building blocks and step-by-step, piece by piece, <em>builds</em> complex systems. (A great example, which is within the grasp of an individual person, is a complex 3D game done with an engine such as Unity. Besides its complexity it makes for a good analog, since it is indeed building a certain world, with certain rules, such as gravity.)<br />
So the argument is that there are certain universal truths, and fundamental ways that things can work which computer science will need to take advantage of, of which complex natural systems already do.  And so sooner or later, the top-down investigative approach of science, and the bottom-up creating approach of computer science will meet in the middle (at what we might call Truth...)
</p>
<p>Or put another way:<br />
  - Science is discovering secrets. - Computer science is making them...<br />
</p>
<p>- So, discovery vs. making... drilling down, vs. building up.</p>
<p>- Here's another original quote: &quot;Coding is the new Lego&quot;. i.e. there are only so many basic pieces, but limitless possibilities of what you can do with them.</p>
<p>- You very likely ***will*** see programming again if you pursue post-secondary education, either as part of another course, or as a required course. Anything at all technical or scientific will likely require at least one programming/CS course, and it is a common elective even in Arts programs.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To IBCS or not to IBCS</strong>...</p>
<p>- Half the course is programming, half is the theory of how computer and computer systems work.</p>
<p>- HL is just an extension - more content at a higher level - than SL. The theory part of the HL course is no more complex, but the programming is more complex than the SL requirements.</p>
<p>- Those who do well are those who are fairly good at three things: languages, logic, and creativity.</p>
<p>- You should consider IBCS if thinking about further study in IT, a specific science (as opposed to needing to take two sciences for Medicine), or engineering.</p>
